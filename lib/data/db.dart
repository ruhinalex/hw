          "There have been a number of pace bowlers from the southern belt of Bangladesh: Manjurul Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza, Syed Rasel, Rubel Hossain and Robiul Islam. Al-Amin Hossain, born and bred in Jhenidah in the south of the country, is the next man in line, and he started his international career in 2013 after becoming a viable option through impressive starts in domestic cricket. After being noticed by Bangladesh's fast bowling guru Sarwar Imran sometime in 2011, Al-Amin was asked to attend a pace bowlers' camp in the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. He began with 39 wickets in his debut first-class season for Khulna Division in the 2011-12 season. He didn't instantly come to notice, but he was enrolled into the BCB's National Cricket Academy soon after. He soon made it to the Bangladesh A side, after which it was a matter of time as he kept on performing well in the domestic competitions. Soon after his Test and T20 debut in late 2013, he took five wickets in one over in a domestic T20 game for UCB-BCB XI in Sylhet. He says he finds it more comfortable playing T20 than any other format, but he has done well in ODIs for Bangladesh, becoming the highest wicket-taker in the ODI series in the West Indies in August 2014.
